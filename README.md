### Tecnologies
React.js to create single page application
PostgreSQL - CRUD database
Shutterstock API to fetch videos
Socket.io - communication between user and tour operator

### Approach 
I tackled the backend first, starting with seeding the database. Then I began building out my React components. I finished off by setting up the CRUD function and routes.
Installation instructions for any dependencies
NPM install
Socket.io

### User story
Possible users: 
Time constraint - limited traveling time
Transport between destinations
Discomfort of being in a foreign land not knowing the language nor which areas are safe.

### Unsolved problems or major hurdles 
Fetching the API with user authorization on the front end. This was the first time I had to encode the API credentials in order to fetch data from the front end.
Update function - I did not have enough time for this.
User models - I wanted to build this out, but did not have enough time for it.
